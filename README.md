Makes it easy and fast to share a file on your local network

We, geeks, like to code in the same room. While doing so, sharing our last kick-ass snipet or a cool song we downloaded recently should not be a pain in the ass as finding an usb stick is. Why not throw it through the local network ? Just do:

```
$ throw cool_song.mp3
```

... and your file will be served on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
